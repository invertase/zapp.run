# Packages

Zapp! supports using any web compatible Dart and/or Flutter package. You can find 
packages on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/), the official package repository for Dart and Flutter.

Once you've found a package, you can check whether it's compatible by idenfying whether the Web
platform is listed, for example:

## Installing Packages

Much like a local project, you can add packages to the `dependencies` section of your
`pubspec.yaml` file. For example:

```yaml
name: flutter_app
description: A new Flutter project.

environment:
  sdk: '>=2.18.2 <3.0.0'

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^0.13.5
```

Once added, you can install the package by either building your application, by running
the 'pub get' command, or the 'Pub Get' editor action.

## Using Packages

Once installed, simply import the package at the top of any `.dart` file in your project:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

var url = Uri.https('example.com', 'whatsit/create');
var response = await http.post(url, body: {'name': 'doodle', 'color': 'blue'});
```

[IntelliSense](/features/intellisense) support is built directly into the editor, so you can easily identify any 
available classes, methods, properties or errors with your package usage.

## Package Versions

Much like you'd expect from your local environment, you can specify a version range for any package you
install. For example:

```yaml
http: ^0.13.5  # Install version 0.13.5 or later, but before 0.14.0
http: '0.13.5' # Install version 0.13.5 specifically
http:          # Install the latest version of the package
```
