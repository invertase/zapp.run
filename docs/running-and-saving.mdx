# Running & Saving

Once you've written some code, you'll want to run it and save it. To execute this process, press the run button in the top right of the editor:

![Run button](/assets/running-and-saving-example.png)

Once successful, the preview will update with the output of your code, and the code will be saved.

## Updating project information

When you fork a project, the project title & description will also be copied. You can update these by clicking the edit icon within the editor:

The title & description will display to anyone viewing your project, and in meta tags when sharing your project (e.g. via URLs, social cards etc).

## Limitations

We're aware of the current limitations, and are working on ways to resolve these (please bear with us, it's complicated!):

- If the build process errors, the project code will not be saved (read; it is currently not possible to save code that cannot compile).
- Saving & Building are tied to the same process - you cannot save code without building.
- Build speed depends upon your local machine specs. We're working hard to improve compilation speeds.
  - On Apple Silicon chips, compilation on average takes between 900-1200ms on first runs. Subsequent runs are much faster (~200ms).
  - On Intel chips, compilation on average takes between 6-15 seconds on first runs. Subsequent runs are much faster (~2 seconds).
- Changing the Dart/Flutter version manually is currently not supported - we're working to make this possible in the future.
