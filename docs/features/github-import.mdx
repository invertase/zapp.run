# GitHub Import

Zapp! supports importing any Dart or Flutter application directly from GitHub.
This is a great way to quickly showcase an application without setting up a local environment.

Importing from GitHub is also beneficial if you wish to maintain examples alongside your own
pub package and not worry about syncing with Zapp!

## Importing a GitHub repository

Zapp! supports importing projects from the root of a repository, sub-directory,
branch, ref, or tag.

Provide the direct GitHub URL pathname to the URL `https://zapp.run/github/<path>`,
and the code will be imported.

1. [https://zapp.run/github/roaa94/flutter_3d_calculator](https://zapp.run/github/roaa94/flutter_3d_calculator)

**Example 2: Importing a sub-directory**

1. [https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod/tree/master/packages/flutter_riverpod/example](https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod/tree/master/packages/flutter_riverpod/example)
1. [https://zapp.run/github/rrousselGit/riverpod/tree/master/packages/flutter_riverpod/example](https://zapp.run/github/rrousselGit/riverpod/tree/master/packages/flutter_riverpod/example)

### Requirements

When importing a GitHub repository, the following requirements must be met:

- The repository path provided must contain a `pubspec.yaml` file.
- The repository path provided must contain runnable example, Zapp! supports:
  - `lib/main.dart`
  - `example/main.dart`
  - `example/example.dart`
  - `example/lib/main.dart`
- The repository must be less than 35 MB in size.

### Caching

Imported GitHub projects will be cached based on the latest Commit SHA - if you modify the code on GitHub,
the next import of the project will re-import the latest code.

## Importing a GitHub Gist

Gists are a common way to share snippets of code without managing a repository.

You can import Gists via the URL `https://zapp.run/gist/<id>`.

### Example

1. Gist: [https://gist.github.com/flutterdevrelgists/ecabed4a17a3aad8bee7c6327e472fc8](https://gist.github.com/flutterdevrelgists/ecabed4a17a3aad8bee7c6327e472fc8)
1. Import: [https://zapp.run/gist/ecabed4a17a3aad8bee7c6327e472fc8](https://zapp.run/gist/ecabed4a17a3aad8bee7c6327e472fc8)

### Requirements

When importing a GitHub Gist, the following requirements must be met:

- The Gist must contain a `main.dart` file.
- The Gist may optionally contain a `pubspec.yaml` file (if not provided, one will be automatically generated).

### Caching

Gists are cached based on their ID along with the latest updated timestamp. If you modify the Gist,
the next import of the project will re-import the latest code.
