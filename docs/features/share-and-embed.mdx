# Share & Embed

All projects on Zapp! can be shared with anyone else on the web (private projects coming later). 
If someone else edits your project, it will be [forked](/forking).

Simply copy the URL of your project and share it with anyone.

## Embedding

Projects can also be embedded on 3rd party websites via an [`iframe`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).
When you embed a project, a configurable simplified editor will be displayed instead, however the UI will offer the option to open the
project directly on Zapp! allowing users to experience the full editor.

You can embed projects by creating an `iframe` with the URL of your project, including Pub & GitHub imports, for example:

```html
<iframe src="https://zapp.run/edit/flutter"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://zapp.run/gist/ecabed4a17a3aad8bee7c6327e472fc8"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://zapp.run/github/Yczar/solar-system"></iframe>
<iframe src="https://zapp.run/pub/http/0.13.5"></iframe>
```

Embedding is great for tutorials, documentation, and more.

### Via Zapp! IDE

To embed a project via the Zapp! IDE interface, press the "Share" button in the top right of the editor and then the "Embed" option.

A dialog will show configuration options including the ability to copy the embed code,
modify the theme, lazy load and the default editor view.

Close the dialog by clicking on the Zapp window behind the dialog.

### Manual embedding

To embed a project, simply add the following to your website:

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://zapp.run/edit/flutter" 
  style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0; overflow: hidden;">
</iframe>
```

> Change out the `src` for your own project URL.

This will display the embedded preview, taking up the maxium width and height of the parent element.

#### View Type

By default, the editor will show either the code editor, preview or both depending on the available width the embed has.
To override this, you can configure the `split` search param to be a value between 0 & 100 (percentage):

```html
<!-- Default (split based on available width): -->
<iframe src="https://zapp.run/edit/flutter"></iframe>

<!-- 50/50 editor and preview -->
<iframe src="https://zapp.run/edit/flutter?split=50"></iframe>

<!-- 75/25 editor and preview -->
<iframe src="https://zapp.run/edit/flutter?split=75"></iframe>

<!-- 100 (editor only) -->
<iframe src="https://zapp.run/edit/flutter?split=100"></iframe>

<!-- 0 (preview only) -->
<iframe src="https://zapp.run/edit/flutter?split=0"></iframe>
```

#### Lazy Loading

Lazy loading prevents the editor from downloading until interaction has occurred - helping to reduce initial bandwidth usage
if the embed is not too important to your page.

To enable lazy loading, add the `lazy=true` search param to the `iframe` src:

```html
<iframe src="https://zapp.run/edit/flutter?lazy=true"></iframe>
```

#### Theme

By default, the editor theme (light or dark) will use the users preference (if set) or the default theme operating system.

To force override this, add the `theme` search param as `light` or `dark` to the `iframe` src:

```html
<iframe src="https://zapp.run/edit/flutter?theme=dark"></iframe>
```

#### Multiple Params

Multiple params may be set at the same time.  An example using split, theme, and lazy:

```html
<iframe 
        src="https://zapp.run/edit/flutter?split=85&theme=light&lazy=true" 
        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0; overflow: hidden;">
</iframe>
```
