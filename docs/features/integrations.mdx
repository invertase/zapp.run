# Integrations (PRIVATE BETA)

The Zapp! editor is powered by a number of integration services, which are unique to the Zapp! platform.
If you have a service or product which could benefit from the below integrations, please get in touch
with us via [Discord](https://zapp.run/on/discord).

<Info>
  The integration APIs are a paid service. Please contact us for more
  information.

## Compiler

The Zapp! compiler is a JavaScript script which enables compilation of a Dart or Flutter application
into a runnable web application. The compiler is fully browser based, and can be used to compile
projects on the fly directly from the browser.

Alongside this the compiler is extremely performant, being able to compile large applications in
seconds (sometimes even milliseconds!).

```js
// Your domain based API key
const API_KEY = "...";

// Import the Zapp! JS compiler
const compiler = await import(
  `https://cdn.zapp.run/compiler.min.js?key=${API_KEY}`
);

// Load a file system into the compiler
await compiler.loadFileSystem({
  "pubspec.yaml": "...",
  "lib/main.dart": "...",
});

// Update any pub dependencies
await compiler.runPubGet();

// Compile the Flutter app!
const output = await compiler.run("lib/main.dart");

// Mount the Flutter app to the DOM
compiler.mount(output, document.getElementById("flutter-app"));
```

### Features

The compiler supports the following:

- Compilation of Dart and Flutter applications into a mountable web application.
- Multiple-file support.
- Package support via `pubspec.yaml`.
- Asset support (both local and package assets).

## Analyzer

The Zapp! compiler is a JavaScript script which enables running the Dart analyzer on a Dart or Flutter
codebase. The analyzer returns detailed information about an application, such as errors & warnings,
along with meta-information about the application (for example, the Widget outline).

The analyzer is a performant browser based implementation of the Dart analyzer.

```js
// Your domain based API key
const API_KEY = "...";

// Import the Zapp! JS analyzer
const analyzer = await import(
  `https://cdn.zapp.run/compiler.min.js?key=${API_KEY}`
);

// Load a file system into the analyzer
await analyzer.loadFileSystem({
  "pubspec.yaml": "...",
  "lib/main.dart": "...",
});

// Run the analyzer and get the output
const output = await analyzer.run();
```

## Remote Builds

The remote build service powers both the [Pub Import](/features/pubdev-previews)
& [GitHub Import](/features/github-import) features. The remote build service is an API endpoint
accepting a Dart or Flutter application (as an archive), and returns a compiled web application.

The remote build service is a performant, server based implementation of the Zapp! compiler.
