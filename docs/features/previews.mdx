# Previews

Zapp! Flutter projects can access instant previews via the `zapp.page` domain. This is a great way to share your work with others,
or to test your project on different devices.

## Previewing your project

To preview your project, add your project ID as the subdomain to `zapp.page`. 

For example if your project URL is `https://zapp.run/edit/my-awesome-app-z41s06g051t0`, visit 
`https://my-awesome-app-z41s06g051t0.zapp.page` to preview your project.

Note; only the random ID is required - if the project URL changes when updating project information,
the preview URL will continue to work for older URLs you might have shared (e.g. `https://z41s06g051t0.zapp.page`
is the only part of the URL that is actually required).

## Preview metadata

The underlying HTML of your preview is pulled directly from the `web/index.html` file in your project (one is automatically
created if you don't have one already). This means you can add any metadata you want to your preview, such as a title, description etc.
Visit the [file explorer](/features/file-explorer) documentation to learn more about the `web` directory.

## Using as a host

Although your projects are exposed to the world via a uniquely hosted URL, we do not recommend using this service as a host for your
Flutter application. We do not provide any guarantees about uptime, and we may change the underlying hosting infrastructure at any time.

Instead, you should opt to use a hosting provider with an underlying CDN, which is able to host your Flutter application behind a cache.
Some options include:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
