# Forking

Projects in Zapp! are owned by a user, who is able to modify the project. If you attempt to build 
and/or make changes to a project you do not have access to, the project will be forked. This means
the original source code and any changes you have made will be copied to a new project under your
ownership.

## Forking a project

You can fork a project proactively by clicking the "Fork" button on the project page. This will
create a new project under your ownership, and copy the source code and any changes you have made.
