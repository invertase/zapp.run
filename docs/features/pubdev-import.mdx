# Pub Example Imports

When building Dart & Flutter applications, you'll most likely be heading over to [https://pub.dev](https://pub.dev) to 
find a package to use within your application. Pub provides an "Example" tab, where developers can
showcase alongside the package how it works. This is great, however part of the problem is
there's no way to run the example without installing it locally, copying parts of the example
and running it locally.

## Importing examples

You can import examples from any web compatible package on pub.dev, and run them directly on Zapp! in seconds. 
This is great for quickly testing out a package, or even for learning how to use a package.

If you make any changes to the imported example, you'll [fork](/forking) the project.

To get started, find the package you wish to try out (for example, [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http)),
and add it to the URL `https://zapp.run/pub/<package>`:

> [https://zapp.run/pub/http](https://zapp.run/pub/http)

The package example will start to be imported, and you'll be notified about any issues (for example 
if no example exists, compilation errors, not null safe etc).

### Package versions

By default, the latest package version will be used. If you wish to try a specific version, provide this
to the URL `https://zapp.run/pub/<package>/<version>`: 

> [https://zapp.run/pub/http/0.13.4](https://zapp.run/pub/http/0.13.4)

If the version does not exist, an error will be shown.

### Requirements

### Requirements

When importing a Pub example, the following requirements must be met:

- The package must have a valid example (an `example` directory co-located with the package source).
- The example must contain runnable example, Zapp! supports:
  - `lib/main.dart`
  - `example/main.dart`
  - `example/example.dart`
  - `example/lib/main.dart`

### Caching

Each specific package version is cached once built for the first time. Once cached,
previewing the example will be near instant.

## Chrome Extension

Install the official Zapp! [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zapp-extension/bbgkmldccfmbpbdkfdhofdkjjafhiekc/related)
to enable an "Open in Zapp!" button on pub.dev. This will open the example in Zapp! directly:
